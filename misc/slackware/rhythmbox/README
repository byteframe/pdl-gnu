Rhythmbox is an integrated music management application originally 
inspired by Apple's iTunes.  It is designed to work with the GNOME 
desktop and based on the powerful GStreamer media framework.

This requires libproxy, gnome-keyring, libsoup, totem-pl-parser, 
gnome-media, gst-python, gnome-python-desktop, brasero, and pywebkitgtk.
vala, avahi, libdmapsharing, and libmusicbrainz are optional dependencies.
